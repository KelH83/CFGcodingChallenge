# CFG intro to Coding Challenge
Solve a series of coding conundrums using flowcharts and pseudocode

I decided to challenge myself to work on this alone rather than in a team  and to attempt to do it all in javascript. I knew as soon as the challenges were revealed that I wanted to create real-world situations and build an interactive web page for each challenge.

**Challenge 1 - Should we round up the final grade?**

Every subject is graded from 0 to 100%. Less than 40% is a failing grade and more than 80% is a distinction. 

We can round up a grade:
If the difference between the  grade and the next multiple of 5  is less than 3, round  up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of  is less than 40, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Given an input grade, round it up if appropriate and tell us if the student passed, failed or received a distinction.  Write an algorithm and produce a flow chart.

**Challenge 2 - Sorting an array**

You have an array of a maximum size of 100 with DISTINCT integers. Write an algorithm and produce a flow chart that sorts this array from smallest to largest. 

**Challenge 3 - Search a number in a sorted matrix**

You are given a matrix (a list of lists) of DISTINCT integers and a target number. Each row in the matrix is SORTED and each column in the matrix is SORTED. Our matrix does not necessarily have the same height and width.

Write a pseudocode and produce a flowchart that:

Finds the number and report back its location (row and column indices of the target integer), if it is contained in the matrix

otherwise report back that the integer is not in the matrix.

**Challenge 4 - Find factorial of n**

The value of n will be small, less than 100. How could we use a lookup table to find the factorial not in the table already. If you would run the program, the first time the look up table would be empty. 

Produce a pseudo code and a flowchart that allows us to find a factorial of a integer n. 

**Challenge 5 - Hide the credit card digits**

There are 16 digits on a credit card. Every 4 digits are separated by a space. Start by generating a random credit card number. 

For security reasons, you are going to hide the first 12 digits on the credit card.
